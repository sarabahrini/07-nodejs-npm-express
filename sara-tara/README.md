## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
We are adding functionality to create new articles and allow users to retrieve them. 

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
The user would need to clone the repository, initialize the project with _npm init_**, then run _npm install_**, and then run the server using _node server.js_** or _nodemon_**.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
We are using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, JSON, AJAX, JQuery, Handlebars.js, Marked.js, Node.js and ExpressJS.
